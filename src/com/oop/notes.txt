Object oriented programming (most imp )
=================================
1. java is a class based language.
2. java class consist 5 element.
   1. Variable
   2. Methods
   3. Constructor
   4. Blocks
   5. Inner class (Nested class)

   Example :
          class <class-name>
        {
          1. Variable
          2. Methods
          3. Constructor
          4. Blocks
          5. Inner class (Nested class)

         }
3. Variable
  a. Variable are used to store data/value.

  Example :
           int rollno = 101;
           whare 'rollno' is a variable thet stored 101 (data/value/constant)

  b. there are three type of variable in java.
  * local variable
     |- Local variable are define inside the Method/Constructor /Block.
     |- Calling of local variable depend on: When Method/Constructor/Block call.
     |- Memory Allocation : Stack

  * instance variable
     |- Instance variable are define inside the class but outside the Methode/constructor/Blocks
     |- Calling of instance variable depend on: object.
     |- Memory Allocation : Heap
     |-How many times memory will create : depend upon number of object, if we have tree object of a class then 3 time memory will create for single IV

  * static variable
     |- Static variable are define inside the class but outside the Methode/constructor/Blocks with prefix 'static'.
     |- Calling of static variable depend on: class.
     |- Memory Allocation : Non-Heap
     |-How many times memory will create : one time.

  c.
  Example:
  Program1

4. Methods
   a. Methods are uses to write the logics of the program.
   b. There are two type of methods
      |- Instance Methods or non-static methods
      |- Static Methods

 Example :
    program2

Calling rule
--------------
1. Instance methods ---Directly---> Instance methods/variable
2. static methods ---Object---> Instance methods/variable
3. Instance methods ---Classname---> Static methods/variable
4. Static methods ---Classname---> Static methods/variable

Example
Program3

Q. How to create object of a class
A. There are 4 ways
   |-Named object
   |-nameless object
   |-Instance object
   |-Static Factory object
--------------------------------------
        |- Named object
        Syntax:
              class-name obj-name = new constructor-name();
        Example:
              Program4 obj1 = new Program4();

        |- Nameless object
        Syntax:
             new constructor-name();
        Example:
              new Program4();

6. Constructor
-----------------
1. Constructor is a special type or method which is invoked implicitly at the time of the object creation.
2. it is used to initialize object.
3. It is also used to initialize instance variable by using default value

      Data-type                       Default value
      ---------------------------------------------------
      byte,short,int,long                    0
      float,double                           0.0
      boolean                                false
      char                                    (1 space)
      String                                 null
      ----------------------------------------------------
4. Types of Constructor
    |- Default Constructor  [Compiler]
       |- Zero Parameterize

    |- User define constructor
       |- Zero or more than Zero Parameterize

5. Constructor-name and class-name should be same
6. Constructor are able to pass parameters.
7. Constructor doesn't have any return-type

8. Example:
        Program12

program15: Difference
program16: How constructor used to initialize IV
Program17:
Program18:
Program21: 'this' keyword : it represent as current class object.
            |- We can use 'this' keyword with
                   |- variable
                   |- method
                   |- constructor
                       |- this should be first statement in constructor

Program.22 :
 7. Blocks
 ------------
 a. Blocks are used to write common logics.
 b. Types of Blocks
    |-Instance Block
          |-Syntax
              {
               // statement
              }
          |- IB logics are common for all object
          |- IB executes at the time of object creation
    |- Static Block
       |- Syntax
             static{
                  // statement
             }
       |-SB logics are common for whole class.

    c. Example:
       Program23:
       Program24:

 8. Inner class
 ------------------
 a. Class inside another class is known as Inner class
 b. Non-static nested class is inner class
 Syntax:
      class Outer
      {
      ......
      class inner
      {
      .......
      }
      }
 c. Inner class can access all the members/element of Outer class
 Examples:
      Outer1
